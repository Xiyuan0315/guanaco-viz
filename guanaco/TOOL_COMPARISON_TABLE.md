### ShinyCell2
- **Unique Features**: Deep R ecosystem integration, publication-ready plots
- **Best For**: R users, traditional bioinformatics workflows
- **Limitations**: Limited scalability (<100K cells recommended)

### Vitessce
- **Unique Features**: Specialized for spatial data, modular multi-view design
- **Best For**: Spatial transcriptomics, coordinated multi-view exploration
- **Performance**: Depends on tiling strategy

### CELLxGENE
- **Unique Features**: Fastest exploration, optimized for very large datasets
- **Best For**: Quick data exploration, large atlas browsing
